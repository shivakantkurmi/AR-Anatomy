## 📖 Description
The **AR Anatomy App** is an educational Augmented Reality (AR) application that utilizes **Vuforia Engine** and **Unity** to track a marker and project anatomical structures in 3D. This interactive experience enhances learning by allowing users to explore human anatomy in real-time.

## 🎯 Features
✅ Marker-based AR tracking using Vuforia  
✅ 3D anatomical models displayed dynamically  
✅ Interactive controls for zooming, rotating, and viewing structures  
✅ Educational tool for students and professionals

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Unity** (Latest version with Vuforia support)
- **Vuforia Engine** (for AR marker tracking)
- **C# Scripting** (for interactivity and controls)
- **Blender** (for modifying 3D models if required)

## 🚀 Installation & Setup
### 🔹 Prerequisites
- Install **Unity** (Latest version with Vuforia support)
- Install the **Vuforia Engine SDK**
- Have a physical or digital **Image Target**

### 🔹 Steps to Run the Project
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ar-anatomy-app.git
   ```
2. Open Unity and load the project.
3. Import the **Vuforia Engine** package if not included.
4. Set up the **AR Camera** and add an **Image Target** in the Unity scene.
5. Assign the desired **3D anatomical model** to the Image Target.
6. Configure the Vuforia License Key in Unity.
7. Build and run the application on a supported device.

## 📌 Usage Instructions
1. Open the application on your device.
2. Point the camera towards the designated marker.
3. The anatomical structure will appear in AR.
4. Use touch gestures to zoom, rotate, and explore the model.

## 📂 Supported Anatomical Models
The app includes multiple anatomical models categorized into different systems:
- **Myology** (Muscular System)
- **Neurology** (Nervous System)
- **Angiology** (Circulatory System)
- **Arthrology** (Joint Structures)
- **Splanchnology** (Visceral Organs)
- **Muscular Insertions** (Attachment points of muscles)

New models can be added by importing 3D assets into Unity and assigning them to Vuforia Image Targets.
